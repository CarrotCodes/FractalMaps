	<h2>Welcome to <span style="font-style: italic;">Mandelbrot Maps</span>!</h2>
	<p>This app is designed to showcase the relationship between the Mandelbrot set and Julia set fractals.
	<p>Move around the fractals with one finger and pinch to zoom. When you zoom, the fractal will rerender with more detail.
	<p>Select \"Set Julia\" from the menu to add a Julia fractal. Change the point defining it by dragging the coloured pin. Tap it to see
	it in more detail.
	<p><b>Mandelbrot Maps</b> is being developed as my undergraduate dissertation project, so any feedback you leave on the Google Play Store page
	is greatly appreciated.
