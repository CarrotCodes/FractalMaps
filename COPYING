Code authors/Copyright holders:

This Android port by Alasdair Corbett is based on Iain Parris's original web applet 
version of Mandelbrot Maps. Some of the colour scheme code is taken from Edward 
Mallia's later version. A third version was produced by Taige Liu but, to the 
best of my knowledge, none of his code was reused.
